This is the project for EE651.

To run you will need matlab installed. Any recent version should work fine.

The main script is ee651_sar_processing.m

At this point you'll have to edit it directly to make it run different processes
like various azimuth compression routines, etc.

The general procedure is:
1. Generate the Range Reference Function
2. Create a matched filter for range compression
3. Perform Range Compression

4. Generate the Azimuth Reference Function
5. Create a matched fiter for azimuth compression
6. Perform Azimuth Compression
